          <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> The
          <strong>Paith</strong> festival in Raskot, Nepal is a cultural and
          religious celebration that dates back generations. It is headed by
          local priests, and they bust into a traditional rhythmic telegraph
          dance where each track seems to be rehearsed. It is a special dance
          which makes this day unique, symbolizing the religious bond of the
          community with their gods. Some of the villagers offer garlands,
          incense sticks and raw rice as a mark of reverence to Goddess Polemma
          for divine blessings with family wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Priests say prayers in the name of not only themselves at but also for
          families who may be unable to attend on festival day, so everyone is
          included spiritually with resulting benefits. The offerings are made
          collectible to the ancestors and gods rather than as a measure of any
          intent. A sacred environment abounds in the religious air with
          prayers, which echo through chants and rituals that promotes their
          culture and spiritual belief.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from the religious aspect, Paith is a another social injection
          togetherness and stalls for serving native cuisines by local vendors.
          The energy of the place pulls large gatherings that makes a assembling
          marketplace around these spiritual events. The distinct amalgam of
          faith, culture and community spirit are elements by which the local
          society distinguishes itself from other communities nearby and hence
          have succeeded in turning Paith into a focal event for Raskoties such
          that now it is not only celebrated as occasion to honor gods but also
          eyes upon celebrations.
